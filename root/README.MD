# Project Title

Tic-Tac-Toe Game as the first project by General Assembly & Misk


### List of technologies used

HTML - CSS - JS - jQuery - Google fonts - SweetAlert


### The problem & how did I approach it

This will be discussed during presentation

### Future planning

1- Play against the computer  
2- Support wider range of display sizes  
3- Improve animation and user experience within the game 


### How You solved for the winner
By creating a Flexbox design, I reached every element in the desire spot  
and store its value in an array. A function, with every iteration, will be called to process  
the user input and look for a matching result. If so the  
the user will be prompted the winner and give the ability to continue the game.  
By continuing the game the user will be able to keep track of current winning and losing stats or clear them  
to start the whole game over.

### Some functions that I like
The clearBoard as well as the checkWinner were undoubtedly the most challenging for me.  
However by completing them with the expected behavior I learnt much more about the logic and how to approach big problems
